Insults for the "HaterMatic" project

This code uses SparkFun's 6-value coin accecptor (COM-11636) and thermal
printer (COM-10438) to allow people to pay to have a piece of harsh language
directed at them. This file contains the actual insults.
Resources:
SoftwareSerial library
avr/pgmspace.h
Development environment specifics:
Developed in Arduino 1.0.5
Developed on a SparkFun Arduino Pro Mini 5V/16MHz (DEV-11113)
This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!

// These define the number of insult strings for each tier. This limits the
//  number of insults that can be selected from; don't forget to increment (or
//  decrement!) this value if you add (or remove) insults.

#define NUM_V 4  // Number of "value" level insults.

// While this "double-define" thing, where we declare a variable, then declare
//  an array with those variables in it, looks hokey, it's how you *need* to
//  write strings into flash memory. If the strings were simply inlined into
//  the meta-array, you'd end up with an array of pointers to RAM locations
//  and only the pointers would be stored in flash; the strings would still be
//  in RAM, clogging up your tubes.

I'm leaving this section in, but commented, because it's a useful example of
what *not* to do. The way I've done things here, you end up with an array of
pointers to strings stored in SRAM stored in flash, *not* an array of strings
stored in flash. See above for the correct, albeit clumsy, way to do it.
